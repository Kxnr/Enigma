# Enigma Simulator


## Description

This is a basic project to replicate the functionality of the original Enigma machine in simulation. This is not a replication of the code breaking work that was developed to break the Enigma code, though I hope to tackle that at some point. More directly, this project was a chance to work with some different approaches to design patterns. The choices I made then are perhaps not the choices I would make now; the problem, however, is a great one for thinking about design as the components themselves are relatively simple but need to interact in interesting ways.

## Setup

### Dependencies

* Python >= 3
* numpy

### Executing program

The default main block will print a historically encoded message and render it into the original German.

```
python Enigma.py
```
